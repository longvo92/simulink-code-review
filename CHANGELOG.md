# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-24

First stable release. The tool grew from "write an HTML report" into three
front ends over one compare core, and the classification vocabulary settled,
so the API and the verdicts are now considered stable.

### Added

- **Side-by-side viewer** (`--qt`, PySide6): folder tree plus a two-pane
  old/new diff aligned line-for-line and scrolled in lockstep, with the exact
  changed characters highlighted inside each line.
  - **VS Code-style minimap**: the file's code shape in miniature, changed
    lines striped in their colour, draggable viewport slider.
  - **Quick-changes panel**: the `--arxml-only` rollup live in the app —
    updated ARXML/A2L files, port interfaces, software components, ports,
    runnables, events, RTE access points, A2L objects. Click a row to jump.
  - **Change navigation** (`F7` / `F8`) skipping noise, with the current block
    highlighted on both sides and a `change 3 of 7` counter.
  - **Drag & drop** the OLD/NEW folders onto the window; **Export report…**
    (`Ctrl+E`) writes the CLI's HTML report.
  - **Category rules**: unticking `Comment` / `Unimportant` re-judges each
    affected file as Identical or Modified, instantly and without rescanning.
    Real changes can never be folded away.
- **Comment as its own change category**, separate from the other ignorable
  kinds (UUIDs, timestamps, renames, whitespace). Counted separately in the
  CLI, with its own report badge, tree marker and line colour (purple).
- **One packaged binary** — `.\build.ps1` produces `dist\compare-tool.exe`
  carrying the CLI, the tkinter panel and the viewer together.
- Shared `view_model` (whole-file alignment + intra-line spans) so the report
  and the viewer can never disagree about what changed.

### Changed

- The folder tree always shows the whole structure; a verdict never removes a
  row, so the layout does not shift while reviewing.
- Exported reports are built from the raw scan, never from the folded
  on-screen view: a category hidden in the viewer still appears in the file
  with its real verdict.
- Packaging is a single script and spec (replacing the separate CLI and viewer
  builds). The binary is a console build on purpose so terminal runs keep
  stdout and the exit code the CI gate depends on.

### Fail-safe behaviour (unchanged, restated)

- Anything that cannot be *proven* to be noise is reported as a real change.
- A path that could not be listed, read or compared is a loud `error`: exit
  code `2`, a red banner in the report and in the viewer, never a silent
  omission — and `--exit-zero` does not suppress it.
