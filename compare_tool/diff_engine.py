"""Two-pass diff + hunk classification.

Pass 1: diff raw lines -> ALL textual differences (shown when toggle is ON).
Pass 2: diff normalized-shadow lines (+ rename map for C) -> REAL differences.
A raw hunk that does not intersect any real hunk is ignorable; it is labeled
by testing single normalization rules one at a time.

Hunk dict: {kind, old_range: [i1, i2), new_range: [j1, j2)}  (0-based lines)
kind in {real, moved, comment, rename, uuid, timestamp, whitespace, mixed}

Moved blocks: a pure-delete hunk whose non-blank shadow content reappears
verbatim as exactly one pure-insert hunk (and vice versa) is labeled 'moved'
instead of 'real'. Moved hunks carry 'moved_to' / 'moved_from' (1-based line
in the other file). Fail-safe: ambiguous or partial matches stay 'real', and
a moved-only file still counts as real-change (statement reordering can be a
semantic change).
