"""Renderer-agnostic diff view model shared by the HTML report and the Qt
side-by-side viewer.

Two primitives, both free of any HTML/Qt specifics so either renderer can
consume them:

* ``char_span`` -- the intra-line highlight as plain character offsets (one
  contiguous changed span per side, common prefix/suffix excluded). The HTML
  report wraps the span in ``<span class="chg-seg">``; the Qt viewer applies a
  ``QTextCharFormat`` over the same offsets. Keeping the offsets here means the
  two renderers can never disagree on WHAT changed inside a line.

* ``aligned_rows`` -- whole-file alignment of an old/new pair given its
  classified hunks: every line emitted once, changed blocks padded on the
  shorter side so old and new stay row-for-row aligned. This is the natural
  Beyond-Compare two-pane model. (The HTML report keeps its own grouped
  context-window rendering; it only shares ``char_span``.)
